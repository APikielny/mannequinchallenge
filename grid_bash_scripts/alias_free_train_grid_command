how to run on grid:
cd logs
qsub -cwd -l gpus=1 -l gmem=24 -m abes ../alias_free_train_mannequin_on_grid.sh

The -cwd flag ensures that the script runs in this directory and ensures that output lands here.
Also, for some reason without the gpus it seems like the venv doesn't activate? We need gpus regardless
